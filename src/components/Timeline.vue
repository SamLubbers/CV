          The third year of my bachelor's was a placement year, a year dedicated
          to work in industry.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-1">
          During the first internship of my placement year I advanced my
          <strong>Python</strong> skills with the books

            <i>Automate the boring stuff with Python</i>

          I also started learning machine learning with the online course

          For the final year thesis of my Computer Science bachelor's, I
          implemented and evaluated various systems that make use of computer
          vision and machine learning techniques to automatically identify land
          use in rainforests based on satellite images.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my thesis I gained experience with the Python libraries

          Because of the pressing climate and ecological crisis, after finishing
          my bachelor's I declined the offer to do a master's in Machine
          Learning at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology and decided instead
          to work full time for Extinction Rebellion, one of the fastest growing
          and most powerful grassroots movements in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I primarily work as part of the tech team responsible for developing,
          implementing and maintaining the technical infrastructure of
          Extinction Rebellion Nederland. In this team, I
          <strong>
            lead the development of an
            <a
              href="https://github.com/xrnl/aginun/wiki/Purpose"
              target="_blank"
            >
              open source volunteer platform</a
            ></strong
          >, I
          <strong
            >ensure the effective and secure use of the member database and mass
            mailer</strong
          >, and I
          <strong>
            improve
            <a href="https://extinctionrebellion.nl/" target="_blank">
              the website</a
            ></strong
          >. I am also
          <strong>responsible for recruiting and assisting people</strong> to
          develop and maintain other systems, such as our self-hosted cloud
          service, encrypted email, wiki and live streaming system.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my work in the tech team, I have given 15 talks to a
          total of 300 people as part of the outreach team, and I assit the
          integration team with increasing the retention rate of new members.
